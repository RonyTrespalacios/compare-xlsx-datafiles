# Excel File Processor Application

This application processes Excel files by matching and sorting data, and it provides a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5. The application can be packaged into a standalone `.exe` file for easy distribution.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your environment, run the application, and package it into an executable file.

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the necessary Python packages to run the application:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install PyQt5
pip install openpyxl
```

If you need to package the application into a standalone executable, install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

To run the application, navigate to the /src directory and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

To package the application into a .exe file, use the following command from within the /src directory:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```
